GIF the Web
=============

Have you ever wished Facebook animated GIFs like a real website?

Have you ever wanted gchat (including hangouts!) to show images inline?

Well, now they do.

Currently for Chrome. [Get it now!][chrome] If anyone wants to port it to Firefox, that'd be cool.

## `~/.js`

Use [dotjs]? No problem. Just dump [`facebook.com.js`][fb] and [`mail.google.com.js`][gchat] in your `~/.js`.
